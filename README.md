## DX pong\!


</div>

### Description

DX pong is rather neat version of the classic game Pong. It uses DirectX 7 and so you must have that installed on your computer to play. The graphics are detailed smooth - they run at over 50 frames per second on my 400Mhz PC. Cheesy sound effects are included too, but the best thing about this game is the computer's intelligence. Rather than blindly chasing tha ball (like I've seen many other pong games do), it predicts the path of the ball (even if it is going to bounce off several walls) and makes a decision that is not always perfect. The way the computer moves looks like a human player and so it is difficult but not impossible to beat. Have fun, and then come back and vote for me. I usually provide a screenshot, but I don't know how to do that for Direct X games - could someone tell me? Thanks.
